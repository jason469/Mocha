# Mocha
> Created by Jason Liu<br>
> This app is currently in **active development**

### What is Mocha?
Mocha is a mobile application, designed to be a calendar and note-taking application. <br>
Users can create events and record their own notes. These events and notes can be shared with other users on the platform, and also be filtered and arranged. <br>
Push notifications will also be employed to remind users of upcoming events

### What technologies does this app use?
This application uses the following technologies:
- _**NodeJS/Express**_ makes up the backend
- _**Flutter**_ is used for the frontend
- _**MongoDB**_ is used as the database

While an application of this size would benefit more from a SQL database (like Postgres), MongoDB was used instead to give me an opportunity to explore using a no-SQL database. 

**_Flutter_** was chosen because it allows cross-compatibility with Android and Apple phones. 

### Future plans for the app
This application is currently in active development, and will begin as a mobile application for Android devices.<br>
